# Computation in the Physical SciencesQuest University CanadaOctober - November 2015**Class Hours:**1:00PM to 4:00PM, in Room # TBD**Tutor:**Tiffany Timbers, OFFICE LOCATION </br>**e-mail:** tiffany.timbers@gmail.com </br>**website:** www.tiffanytimbers.com </br>
**twitter:** @TiffanyTimbers**Prerequisites:** Information, Measurement and Algebra Q Skills Strands. 
**Course Description:** Take your Question to the next level with high level computational open source software: Python! Students begin with the basics of coding in the first few days: variables, loops and functions. Students will learn critical practices to carry out a computational project from beginning to end, including code modularization, readability and re-use, as well as version control to organize their coding projects and collaborate effectively. Ultimately, students will use these tools to analyze their own datasets in a term project. For preparation, students will work through a sample dataset from a radioactive isotope decay experiment together as a class. Skills will be taught via a combination of live-coding sessions and work-along sessions. Think of it as a three hour hackathon each day of the block. 

**Course Learning Objectives** </br>
• Students will be able to independently complete a computational science project using Python</br>
• Students will be able to version control their computational projects using Git and Github</br>
• Students will be able to solve computational problems with modular, reusable, readable and reproducible code </br>
• Students will be able to disseminate the purpose, usage and outputs of code they write via thorough code commenting, README's, and Jupyter notebooks </br>

</table>

* **Quizzes** will occur frequently, be short, and consist of multiple choice and short answer questions covering code syntax, project organization and general principles of scientific coding.

* **Assignments** will consist of applying the material learned in class to the students final project. Assignment grading will be broken down as 40% for the planning and documentation of how the problem will be solved, 20% for how accurate the code is, 20% for how reusable the code is, and 20% for how readable the code is. In other words, code that does not work can get a maximum of 40%.   

*  **Group Code Review** will be done in preassigned small groups of ~ 3-4 and facilitated by the tutor. Students will take turns sharing some code that they have recently written. When a student shares their code, they will take 1 minute to explain the purpose of their code. The other students will then take 5 minutes to silently read the shared code and make comments on it. Next, each student will be given 4 minutes to share their most important piece of feedback on the code. All participants will be expected to follow a strict code of conduct, which is essentially, be a nice person. The assessment for the group code review will be 20% for presentation of your code, 30% for written comments on others code, and 50% for oral discussion of feedback on others code.

*  **Final Project** topic will be decided on in the first week and ideally fall under the umbrella of the student's question. This will be done in consultation with the tutor. Students will work on the project over the duration of the course, applying what they learned in each class to their project with the daily assignments. Students will also be given 6 hours of in-class time to work on the final project at the end of the course. During these in class work-along sessions, students are encouraged to consult the tutor and each other for help when needed. The project will be done under version control and submitted as a repository to Github. This assessment will consist of a proposal (5%), the public repository (5%), a final written report (10%), and Jupyter notebook presentation of the project (5%).

## Course Software

We will be working in the Bash Shell and Python, as well as performing version control with Git and Github. Installation instructions for the required Software can be found below. Please try to have these installed for the first day of class. If you have trouble with installation I will be having an office hour to help with installation issues on Mon Oct 27 from 11am -12 noon.

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h2>The Bash Shell</h2>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Download the Git for Windows
	<a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">installer</a>. Run the
        installer. <strong>Important: on the 6th page of the installation wizard (the
        page titled `Configuring the terminal emulator...`) select `Use Windows'
        default console window`. If you forgot to do this programs that you need
        for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the
        installer and select the appropriate option.</strong> This will provide you
        with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.
      </p>

</div>

<div id='git'> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. GitHub browser compatability
           is given at https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/-->
  <h2>Git</h2>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
        install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
        install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="editor"> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h2>Text Editor</h2>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h2>Python</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all <a
      href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility'>supported</a>

## Course Policies###Assessments•	All assessments are due at 12:00 noon on the day indicated: one hour before the start of class. •	All assignments will be expected to be submitted electronically via email during the first week of class, and then via Github in the following weeks
•	Any submission that is late, even by one minute, will be given a grade of 0.  You are allowed one exception to this policy, where you are allowed a 24-hour extension to any assessment, with no penalty, provided you have a doctor’s note or some other relevant documentation. •	Any missed quizzes will be made up for by an oral quiz with the tutor. Any missed group code reviews will be made up for by a one-on-one code review with the instructor.### AttendanceIt is expected that you attend every class.  We begin each day at 1:00PM sharp.  If you must miss a class for any reason (*e.g.,* illness, family emergency, religious observance), contact me immediately, by e-mail.  Regardless of the reason, it is your responsibility to catch up on the material you have missed, and obtain the notes from a classmate (not from me).  Any missed quizzes will be made up for by an oral quiz with the tutor. ### Technology You will need a laptop for all classes as we will be coding every single class. Please be respectful with cellphones during class and if you must make/take a call/text during classroom hours, please leave the classroom to do so. ### Scheduling MeetingsIf you have an Academic Accommodation Plan, please make an appointment to see me on the morning of Day 1. I look forward to learning how I can be of service to you.If you have any other questions or concerns about the course, speak to me at the end of class (at 4PM), or contact me by e-mail, and we will set up a one-on-one meeting at a mutually convenient time. ### GradingWe will use the following scale to convert numerical scores into letter grades:<table>
	<tr>
		<td>A</td>
		<td>93% – 100%</td>
		<td>C+</td>
		<td>77% – 79%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A-</td>
		<td>90% – 92%</td>
		<td>C</td>
		<td>73% – 76%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>B+</td>
		<td>87% – 89%</td>
		<td>C-</td>
		<td>70% – 72%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>B</td>
		<td>83% – 86%</td>
		<td>D</td>
		<td>60% – 69%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>B-</td>
		<td>80% – 82%</td>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>0% – 59%</td>
	</tr>
</table>If you disagree with any mark you receive, you must e-mail me to request an appointment, and we will set up a time to meet sometime the following day.  At this time (and not before), we will discuss your concerns and you may ask for the assignment/quiz to be regraded.  If you wish an assignment regraded, I reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment/quiz (not just a particular question), which means that your grade could go down upon regrading. ### PlagiarismAs with all other courses at Quest, you are expected to adhere to the university honour code.  In this course, any blatant act of cheating will receive a zero for the first offense, and an automatic failure for the second offense.  In both cases, I will immediately report the incident to the Chief Academic Officer.
